# MBC Network

PyNEST implementation of the spatio-temporal sequence learning model proposed by [Maes et al. 2020](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007606).
`MBC` therefore stands for the three authors of the original study: Meas, Barahona and Clopath.

[Maes et al. 2020](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007606) proposed a biologically plausible model based on a spiking recurrent neural network supplemented with read-out neurons.
After learning, the recurrent network develops precise switching dynamics by successively activating and deactivating small groups of neurons.
The read-out neurons are trained to respond to particular groups and can thereby reproduce the learned sequence.

We identified some discrepancies between the paper and the code and repaired numerical errors which we describe in [Oberl√§nder et al. 2022](). Our MBC replication serves as an accessible and maintainable implementation of the model which is more consistent with its description in text and tables and contains fewer errors. The model is therefore on a substantially better footing to serve as a basis for future extensions to address new problems or account for more diverse experimental data.

The `mbc_replication` repository contains:

1. [experiments](experiments) directory:

    All experiments including training the recurrent network to developp sequential dynamics and the actual sequence learning process. How to run these experiments can be
    found [here](experiments/README.md).

1. [mbc_network](mbc_network) directory:

    Is a small python library which has to be installed before the training scripts in [experiments](experiments) can be executed.

1. [nestml_models](nestml_models) directory:

    MBC model consists of two different neuron types, where only one of them is provided by NEST. The second neuron model is generated by NESTML and installed into NEST. Source file and installation script can be found in this directory.

1. [tests](tests) directory:

    TBA

1. [environment.yaml](environment.yaml) file:

    Used to create a conda environment including all third-party libraries.

1. [setup.py](setup.py) file:

    Used to install the `mbc_network` library.
